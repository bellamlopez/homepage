            At its core, my practice is rooted in storytelling—an imaginative process sparked by a sense of childlike wonder. As someone who connects most deeply through imagery, my work balances metaphor and bold visual language, often drawing from questions surrounding identity, divine embodiment, and the subconscious.

            Influenced by speculative design and experimental publishing, I approach queerness as both content and method: layered, nonlinear, and fluid. Through research, collaboration, and craft, I return to the body—not as a fixed form, but as a shifting, contested space. Ultimately, my work aims to visualize the in-between—where memory and fiction blur, and where meaning is always shifting. It is an ongoing spiral of disruption, re-imagination, and reclamation.
