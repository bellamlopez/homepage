And in each of these towers the ocean deposited a tiny portion of its pure self, and gave the humans permission to partake of it freely. And the humans gathered around the towers and built their towns and cities around them, and the towers did serve as the eyes and ears of the ocean, and the ocean watched and listened and waited, and for a time, the ocean was content.</p>
