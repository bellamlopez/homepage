        <p class="special">So...Hello World!</p>

        <p>The hand has become <em>increasingly less present</em> in the web as we know it today. Most websites today are built from templates on <a href="https://cargo.site/" target="_blank">website-building platforms</a>, and the knowledge of how to make a website from scratch is relegated to a select few. It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.</p>

        <p>This <strong class="special">course seeks to dispel these ideas</strong> and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and <b>present context of the web.</b>        <img src="assets/radio-mind.png" alt="radiohead 'In Rainbows' Album cover"> We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an <small>important creative space.</small></p>
